I wrote sample test for Spring Hibernate Many-to-Many Unidirectional mapping . 
When I tried to run only 1 out of 4 test cases were running , googled and found some 
solutions suggesting to invlidate the caches. Did it twice but got same error.

Later on I found that the issue is not with Intellij, Test framework or cache. Instead the 
test method decleration had private access modifier for 3 tests out of 4 due to which the tests
were not recognized . seems silly but thought to share this as it actually wasted my 30 mins to figure out 
whats wrong
